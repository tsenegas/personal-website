My name is Thibault Senegas and I am a data scientist at [nüance-R](https://nuance-r.com) where I work on the development of ed-tech simulations ([quantum simulations*](https://quantumsimulations.app)) and on solutions for the digital transformation of companies.

I finished my M.Sc. in International Business from HEC Montreal in 2016 and got a master's engineering degree from INP/ENSIACET (Toulouse, France) with a major in Materials Sciences and a minor in Industrial Systems. I worked at IBM Canada as a data scientist consultant in the Advanced Analytics practice.

I live in Montréal, QC, with my wife and my son.
