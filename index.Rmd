I'm Thibault Senegas, a self-taught programmer turned R and Shiny expert. By day, I'm a Product Owner and Data Scientist at [quantum simulations*](https://quantumsimulations.app) where I lead the development of digital twins for companies, sports teams and geographical areas. 

I hold an M.Sc. in International Business from HEC Montreal (2016) and a Master's degree in Engineering from INP/ENSIACET (Toulouse, France), where I majored in Materials Sciences and minored in Industrial Systems. Prior to my current role, I worked as a Data Scientist in IBM's Advanced Analytics practice.

I reside in Montr√©al, QC, with my wife and two sons.
