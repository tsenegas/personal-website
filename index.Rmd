I'm Thibault Senegas, a self-taught programmer and expert in R and Shiny. As a Lead Data Scientist and Chief Product Owner at [quantum simulations*](https://quantumsimulations.app), I lead the creation of digital twins for companies, sports teams, and geographical regions. My focus is on merging cutting-edge data science with real-world applications.

I hold an M.Sc. in International Business from HEC Montréal and a Master's degree in Engineering from INP/ENSIACET in Toulouse, France. Before joining quantum simulations*, I honed my skills as a Data Scientist at IBM in their Advanced Analytics practice.

This website is a personal project where I explore how advanced data science techniques can be applied to sports analytics (especially in soccer). By leveraging my professional expertise, I seek to demonstrate how these methods can enhance performance metrics, strategy, and decision-making in sports.

I currently reside in Montréal, QC, with my wife and two sons.
